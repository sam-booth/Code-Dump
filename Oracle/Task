"Task is to write a parallelization shell script on top of binary.bin
which will make procession of input faster. 

Write a shell or python script. If shell is chosen, use tools from
coreutils ( no exotic tools ) that will optimize the process by using
some kind of parallelization. Please do not use "parallel" tool - in
99% cases we can't use it in production. Would be cool if it can
accept "-j" argument, like -j64 or -j16, + operate in single-threaded
mode ( essentially running original tool almost as is, if no job
parameter is passed ). Default system is RHEL7 or RHEL8 ( centos 7 or
8 ) with NO EPEL repo.
Ideally you should use as less tools as possible.


Additional questions:

* do we need a lower/upper limit of threads, how should we calculate it ?

* what if my list of files is REALLY large, like 108424  lines ? Does
you solution support it ? Can you make it support it ?

* What if it's a list of words, not a list of strings ? Basically a
long string of words with spaces in between. "
